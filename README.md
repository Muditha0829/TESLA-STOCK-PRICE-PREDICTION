The primary goal of this project is to utilize different regression algorithms, including linear regression, support vector regression (SVR), decision tree regression, and Bayesian regression, to predict the stock price of Tesla. By analyzing and modeling the Tesla dataset, we aim to develop robust and accurate predictions that can aid in understanding the potential trends and patterns in Tesla's stock price movements. This project seeks to provide valuable insights for investors, traders, and financial professionals, enabling them to make informed decisions based on the predicted stock price trends.
